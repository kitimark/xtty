# P3b shell-UX extras — explore-phase decisions (Quick-Terminal + Profiles)

> **Provenance:** Drafted 2026-06-28 during an `/opsx:explore` session for **P3 native-shell-UX**, after the P3a spine was captured + committed (`add-tabs-and-splits`, commit `34bd409`) and the deferred P3b subsystems were drilled. These are **explore-phase, pre-implementation** decisions: P3b is **gated on P3a landing** and its detailed design/specs will be sharper once P3a's real types (`PaneController`, `SessionRegistry`, the config→pane launch path) exist. Grounded in reads of `XttyCore` (`ShellResolver`, `XttyConfigLoader`, `XttyConfig`) and the SwiftTerm checkout. No code written.

> _Topic scope:_ Lock the decisions for the **deferred half of P3** so they aren't lost between now and implementation. P3a (tabs/splits/windows/URL links) is specced in `openspec/changes/add-tabs-and-splits/`; this note covers what was carved out of it. Background: [milestones P3](../04-design/02-milestones.md), [requirements N3 + M6](xtty-requirements.md).

## The re-cut: what P3b actually is

P3's milestone bundles tabs, splits, links, **Quick-Terminal, profiles, and file:line error-matching**. Sorting the deferred features by their real dependencies changed the scope:

| Feature | Depends on | Placement |
|---|---|---|
| Quick-Terminal | P3a (one persistent pane) only | ✅ **P3b** |
| Profiles | P2 config + `ShellResolver` (done) + P3a launch path | ✅ **P3b** |
| file:line error-matching | grid read (done) + **cwd = OSC 7 = P4** for relative paths | ⚠️ **moved to P4** |

- ✅ **P3b = Quick-Terminal + Profiles.** Both are fully buildable once P3a exists.
- ⚠️ **file:line error-matching → P4.** Its core value (clicking `src/foo.swift:42`) needs the pane's cwd, which doesn't exist until P4's OSC 7 capture. The `open-editor-command` config key + matcher land with P4, not here. (URL/OSC-8 links already shipped in P3a; SwiftTerm's implicit matcher is a private, URL-only regex, so file:line is xtty-owned work regardless.)
- ℹ️ **Structure: two tight changes, not one.** Lean toward `add-quick-terminal` + `add-profiles` (independent capabilities; profiles' config-spec churn is large enough to deserve its own review) over a single `add-shell-ux-extras`. One bundled change is acceptable if sequenced as task groups.

## Sequence

```
now:        this note (lock decisions)
then:       /opsx:apply add-tabs-and-splits        (build P3a)
after P3a:  /opsx:propose add-profiles + add-quick-terminal   (full artifacts, referencing this note)
P4:         file:line error-matching rides OSC 7 cwd
```

## Quick-Terminal (the "quake" dropdown)

### Mechanism
- ✅ **Global hotkey via Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey`** — no Accessibility permission prompt (unlike `NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents`, which also can't swallow the key, or `CGEventTap`, which needs the prompt). Registers the combo exclusively; fires when xtty is unfocused.
- ✅ **Hand-rolled ~40-line shim, not the `soffes/HotKey` SPM dep.** The surface is tiny and keeps the dependency list lean (a product value); the reuse-bias is aimed at the VT parser, not a trivial Carbon wrapper. (Reasonable to revisit if touching Carbon is unappealing.)
- ✅ **Panel:** `NSPanel` with `styleMask = [.nonactivatingPanel, .borderless]` (showing it doesn't activate xtty / deactivate the user's app, yet it can become key to receive typing; on hide, focus returns automatically), `level = .mainMenu + 1`, `collectionBehavior = [.canJoinAllSpaces, .fullScreenAuxiliary, .stationary]`.

### Behavior decisions
- ✅ **Lifecycle:** lazily create the panel + a `PaneController` + start the shell on first summon; thereafter the **shell persists** across hide/show — toggling only orders the panel in/out.
- ✅ **Which screen:** the **screen under the mouse** (quake convention), with **summon-to-active** — if visible on a different screen than the active one, re-show it there; if on the same screen, hide. (Diverges from the "main window on the built-in display" rule, which governs the *main* window, not this panel.)
- ✅ **Positioning:** recompute the frame **from the target screen on every show** (never cache — survives resolution change / monitor unplug). Slide in from off-screen (top default).
- ✅ **Single pane in v1** (scratch terminal) — reuses `PaneController`, skips the split tree.
- ✅ **Excluded from the `SessionRegistry` / P5 sidebar and from "last window" accounting** — a special, accessory session.
- ✅ **Termination stance (i): accessory.** The app quits with the last *main* window even if the quake is enabled; the quake shell dies with it. A *hidden* panel must never keep the app alive or block quit. (Stance (ii) — persistent background/status-bar app that survives with no main windows — is a bigger identity shift; noted as a **future option**, not P3b.)

### The pure, testable seam
- ✅ **`HotKeyParser` lives in `XttyCore`** (pure, `swift test`-able): string → `HotKeySpec { virtualKeyCode, carbonModifiers, display }`. Only the actual `RegisterEventHotKey` binding is app-layer/untestable. Mirrors the existing `XttyConfigLoader` (pure) vs `TerminalConfigurator` (AppKit) split.
- ✅ **Fixed name → `kVK_*` table** (~60 entries: letters, digits, F-keys, punctuation, arrows, space, escape, tab, return), **not** layout-aware char translation (`UCKeyTranslate`). keyCodes are positional virtual codes (e.g. `kVK_ANSI_Grave = 0x32`), not characters.
- ✅ **Carbon modifiers ≠ Cocoa** — translate to `cmdKey/shiftKey/optionKey/controlKey`. `fn` is **not** supportable (not a standard Carbon modifier) → reject.
- ✅ **Validation:** require **≥1 modifier + exactly 1 non-modifier key** (a bare global key would hijack the system).
- ✅ **Fail-soft** (consistent with the config posture): an unparseable hotkey **or** a `RegisterEventHotKey` returning non-`noErr` (e.g. a system-reserved combo like ⌘Space) → warn + disable the feature, never crash. We can't enumerate reserved combos, so we handle registration failure rather than predict it.
- ✅ **Handler trampoline:** the `@convention(c)` handler bounces through an `Unmanaged` `self` pointer passed as userData.

### Config + harness
- ✅ **Ship a subset in v1:** `quick-terminal` (on/off) + `quick-terminal-hotkey`. Defer `-position` / `-size` / `-screen` / `-autohide` / `-profile` (the last ties to Profiles) to defaults, land incrementally.
- ✅ **Harness:** a global hotkey can't be driven by XCUITest → expose a **DEBUG "Toggle Quick Terminal" action that calls the identical `toggle()`** the hotkey does, so CI exercises the real path minus the keypress. Assert: panel appears, accepts typed text (via the grid dump), hides, and is **excluded from the registry inventory**.

---

## Profiles (named setting bundles)

### Format
- ✅ **INI-style sections in the same config file.** Lines before the first header = the **base** profile (== today's flat P2 config); `[profile "name"]` starts a named block.
- ✅ **Backward-compatible by construction:** a P2 flat config has no headers → it's entirely the base profile → resolves **byte-for-byte as today**. Migration-free (a spec scenario).

```ini
font-family = JetBrains Mono     # base profile
theme = dark
default-profile = work           # global; honored ONLY in base

[profile "work"]
theme   = light
command = /bin/zsh               # launch override
cwd     = ~/src/work
env-EDITOR = nvim                # repeated env-<NAME> keys → env vars

[profile "ssh-box"]
command = ssh box                # NOT a login shell (no leading-dash)
```

### Parsing edge cases (decisions)
- ✅ Header grammar `^\[profile\s+"([^"]+)"\]$`.
- ✅ Duplicate profile name → **merge** (later keys win) + warn.
- ✅ Empty name `[profile ""]` → warn + ignore.
- ❓ Unquoted header `[profile work]` → strict (warn + ignore) **vs** lenient (accept bare single token) — **open**.
- ✅ `default-profile` inside a profile section → ignored (base-only) + warn.
- ✅ Unknown section type (future `[keybind]`) → ignored, doesn't break the parse (forward-compat, like unknown keys).
- ✅ Unknown `default-profile = nope` → warn + fall back to base.

### Resolution & model
- ✅ A profile splits into **appearance** (→ `XttyConfig`, as today) and **launch** (→ new `LaunchOverride`):

```
XttyProfile   { name; config: XttyConfig; launch: LaunchOverride }
LaunchOverride{ command: String?; cwd: String?; env: [String:String] }
XttyConfigSet { base: XttyProfile; profiles: [name: XttyProfile]; defaultProfileName: String? }

profile.config = resolve(base ⊕ overrides)          # inheritance
pane launch    = (command ? tokenize→exec/args : ShellResolver.resolve())
                 + cwd → startProcess(currentDirectory:)   # SwiftTerm already accepts it
                 + merge env into the seed env
                 + TerminalConfigurator.apply(profile.config)
```

- ✅ **`ShellLaunchConfig` gains `cwd: String?`** threaded to SwiftTerm's `startProcess(currentDirectory:)` (already supported). `ShellResolver` extends with `resolve(override:environment:)` — all pure/testable, matching its existing injected-probe style.
- ✅ **`command` is exec-style** (quote-aware tokenizer → argv, exec directly), **not `sh -c`** — predictable, pure, testable, matches Ghostty's `command`. Document that shell syntax (pipes, `FOO=bar cmd`) isn't supported in `command`; use a wrapper script.
- ✅ **Login-vs-command distinction:** base/default launches a *login* shell (`-zsh`, sources dotfiles — the M5 guarantee); a `command` profile runs the command directly (no leading-dash, no login semantics).
- ✅ **env merge is additive**, profile winning on conflict, **but PATH is off-limits** (the login shell builds it; warn if a profile sets `env-PATH`). Syntax: repeated `env-<NAME> = value` keys (no delimiter ambiguity).
- ✅ **cwd expansion:** `~` / `$HOME` only; a missing dir → warn + fall back to default (don't fail the launch).

### Selection UX + interactions
- ✅ New tab/window → `default-profile` (or base). Menu: **"New Tab with Profile ▸"** submenu.
- ✅ **A split inherits the focused pane's profile** (split an ssh pane → another ssh pane). The profile a pane launched with becomes part of its `Pane` identity in the registry.
- ✅ **Per-profile base font size** ties into P2 cleanly: `PaneController` already holds `configuredFontSize`; for a profiled pane that's the profile's size, so Cmd-0 resets correctly per pane.
- ✅ **Read-once preserved** (P2 policy): config/profiles read at launch; editing needs relaunch (no hot-reload).

### Spec churn (why profiles is NOT in P3a)
```
MODIFIED terminal-configuration: discovery/parsing (sections) · schema (command/cwd/env/default-profile)
                                 · view-free component (now yields XttyConfigSet) · applied-to-terminal (per-profile)
ADDED    terminal-configuration: "Profiles" (named bundles, inheritance, selection)
MODIFIED terminal-session:       profile-driven launch (command/cwd/env; login-vs-command)
MODIFIED verification-harness:   per-pane profileName/cwd in the state-dump inventory
```
This is the largest spec churn in all of P3 — the main reason profiles was carved out of the spine.

## Testability map (what proves what)

```
swift test (pure, XttyCore):  HotKeyParser ; command tokenizer ; cwd expansion ; env merge ;
                              parseSections / inheritance / backward-compat (flat == base)
XCUITest (DEBUG hooks):       quake DEBUG toggle (== hotkey path) → show/type/hide + registry-exclusion ;
                              profile-launched tab → state dump shows theme/font/cwd/profile reflect the profile
untestable (manual/Peekaboo): the real global keypress ; slide animation ; multi-monitor summon
```

## Open questions to resolve at propose/apply time
- ❓ Quick-Terminal: which config keys ship in v1 beyond `quick-terminal` + `quick-terminal-hotkey`.
- ❓ Profiles: strict vs lenient unquoted section headers; the exact quote/escape grammar of the `command` tokenizer.
- ❓ Whether `add-quick-terminal` and `add-profiles` are two changes or one (lean two).
- ❓ Future: the persistent-background quake stance (ii) — out of scope for P3b, revisit if xtty ever wants a status-bar identity.

## Sources
- `XttyCore/Sources/XttyCore/ShellResolver.swift` — `ShellLaunchConfig` (no cwd today), `resolve`/`launchConfig` (pure, injected probes), login `execName = "-" + base`, seed env (no PATH).
- `XttyCore/Sources/XttyCore/XttyConfigLoader.swift` + `XttyConfig.swift` — flat `parse` → `[String:String]`, `resolve` → single `XttyConfig`, fail-soft posture, read-once `load`.
- SwiftTerm checkout (`XttyCore/.build/checkouts/SwiftTerm`): `Mac/MacLocalTerminalView.swift` `startProcess(…, currentDirectory:)`; `Terminal.swift` private URL-only `implicitLinkMatch` / `ghosttyImplicitLinkRegex` (file:line not free); `Mac/MacTerminalView.swift` default `requestOpenLink → NSWorkspace.open`.
- Apple Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey` / `kVK_*` virtual keycodes / Carbon modifier masks (HIToolbox).
- P3a change: `openspec/changes/add-tabs-and-splits/` (proposal/design/specs/tasks) — the spine this note's features were deferred from.
- Milestones: [P3 native-shell-UX, P4 OSC capture](../04-design/02-milestones.md). Requirements: [N3 splits/tabs/Quick-Terminal, M6 agent host](xtty-requirements.md).
